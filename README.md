# Asteroids Survival ðŸš€
> **Game inspired on space ships games from 90's.**

I decided to do this simple game project by a school event, so.. that's not entirely functional, without any errors, if you figure it out how to fix some errors, hands on code.


## What I used to make it ðŸ“‘
- **Code editor:** Sublime Text
- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** Pygame

## About assets ðŸŽ¨
- https://opengameart.org/
- https://itch.io/game-assets
- friendly neighborhood **YOUTUBE.COM**

## Updates ðŸ”ƒ
- Game still crashes sometimes, I think it's amount of asteroids
